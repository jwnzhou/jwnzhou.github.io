I'm a Dietitian and Product Manager based in Toronto. I received my nutrition degree from McGill University and am a Certified Diabetes Educator. My clinical practice has mainly been in virtual care and had the opportunity to be a Health Coach in Canada's first national virtual Diabetes Prevention Program. Seeing how healthcare technology could impact more people than I could counseling 1-on-1, I switched into product management. Currently I'm a product manager at [MealSuite](https://www.mealsuite.com/), a foodservice software company. I still keep up my clinical [private practice](/services) with a focus on chronic disease prevention and digestive health (IBS).
